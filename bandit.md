## Level 3 -> Level 4
The goal of this level is to retrieve the password for the next level, which is stored in a hidden file located in the inhere directory.

### Method
1. I logged into Bandit Level 3 using the following command:
   ```
   ssh bandit3@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
   ```
   I used the password retrieved from the previous level.
2. I navigated to the inhere directory where the hidden file is located:
   ```
   cd inhere
   ```
3. To find hidden files in the inhere directory, I used the `ls` command with the `-a` argument, which lists all files including hidden ones:
   ```
   ls -a
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   .  ..  ...Hiding-From-You
   ```
   
I located the hidden file (`...Hiding-From-You`), which had a name starting with a dot (.), indicating that itâ€™s a hidden file.

```

## Level 4 -> Level 5
The goal of this level is to retrieve the password for the next level, which is stored in the only human-readable file in the inhere directory.

### Method 
1. I logged into Bandit Level 4 using the following command:
   ```
   ssh bandit4@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
   ```
   Used the password revealed in the previous level.
2. I navigated to the `inhere` directory where the human-readable file is located:
   ```
   cd inhere
   ```
3.  In the inhere directory, there were multiple files, but only one was human-readable. To identify the human-readable file, I used the `file` command, which determines the type of each file:
   ```
   file ./*
```
Output: 
```
./-file00: data
./-file01: data
./-file02: data
./-file03: data
./-file04: data
./-file05: data
./-file06: data
./-file07: ASCII text
./-file08: data
./-file09: data
```
Only `./-file07` was readable.

4.  I used the cat command to display its contents and retrieve the password:
   ```
   cat ./-file07
   ```
   which revealed the password for the next level.
Password:
```
4oQYVPkxZOOEOO5pTW81FB8j8lxXGUQw
```

## Level 5 -> Level 6
The goal of this level is to retrieve the password for the next level, which is stored in a file under the `inhere` directory and meets the following criteria:

* Human-readable
* 1033 bytes in size
* Not executable


### Method
1. I logged into Bandit Level 5 using the following command:
   ```
   ssh bandit5@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
   ```
   Used the password revealed in the previous level.

2. I moved into the `inhere` directory where the file is located:
   ```
   cd inhere
   ```
3. To locate the file that meets the specified criteria, I used the find command. This command is highly useful for finding files based on specific properties such as size, permissions, and more. The parameters I used were:
   ```
   find . -type f -size 1033c ! -executable
   ```
   where:
   * `type -f` finds regular files.
   *  `size 1033c` finds the files that are exactly 1033 bytes in size, and
   *  `! -executable`  ensures that the file is not executable.
  
     which gave the filename was
   ```
   ./maybehere07/.file2
   ```
4. I then read the contents of the file and revealed the password for the next level.
   ```
   cat ./maybehere07/.file2
   ```
   Password:
   ```
   HWasnPhtq9AVKe0dmk45nxy20cvUa6EG
   ```

## Level 6 -> Level 7
The goal of this level was to find the password for Bandit Level 7. The password is stored somewhere on the server in a file with the following properties:

* Owned by user: bandit7
* Owned by group: bandit6
* 33 bytes in size

### Method
1. I logged into Bandit Level 6 using the following command:
   ```
   ssh bandit6@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
   ```
   used the password revealed in the previous level.
2. Then I executed the find command to search for the file that matched the required properties:
   ```
   find / -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c
   ```
   where
   `-type f` looks for regular files.
   `-user bandit7` ensures the file is owned by the user bandit7.
   `-group bandit6`ensures the file is owned by the group bandit6.
   `-size 33c` - The file must be exactly 33 bytes.
   which gave many filenames including the ones which were denied permissions.
   From there I figured out one file named as password
   ```
   /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
   ```
3. Then I read the contents of the file and revealed the password for the next level.
   ```
   cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password'
   ```
   Password:
   ```
   morbNTDkSW6jIlUc0ymOdMaLnOlFVAaj
   ```

## Level 7 -> Level 8
The goal of this level was to find the password for Bandit Level 8. The password is stored in the file `data.txt` next to the word "millionth."

### Method
1. I logged into Bandit Level 7 using the following command:
   ```
   ssh bandit7@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
   ```
2. Then I executed the `grep` command to search for the word "millionth":
   ```
    grep "millionth" data.txt
   ```
   which revealed the password for the next level:
   ```
   millionth       dfwvzFQi4mU0wfNbFOe9RoWskMLg7eEc
   ```

## Level 8 -> Level 9
The goal of this level was to find the password for Bandit Level 9. The password is stored in the file `data.txt` and is the only line of text that occurs exactly once.

### Method
1. I logged into Bandit Level 8 using the following command:
   ```
   ssh bandit8@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
   ```
2. Then I ,executed the following command to sort the file and find the unique line:
   ```
   sort data.txt | uniq -u
   ```
   where
   * `sort data.txt` sorts the entire file
   * `|` pipes the output of `sort data.txt` as the input of `uniq -u`
   * `uniq -u` filters out any lines that appear more than once.

   which gave the password for the next level,.
   ```

   ```

## Level 9 -> Level 10
The goal of this level was to find the password for Bandit Level 10, hidden in the file data.txt among non-human-readable characters. The password is preceded by several = characters.

### Method
1.  I logged into Bandit Level 9 using the following command:
   ```
   ssh bandit9@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
   ```
2. Then I executed the following command to extract human-readable text and search for lines with = characters:
   ```
   strings data.txt | grep '==='
   ```
   where
   * `strings data.txt` - extracts human readable strings from `data.txt`
   *  `|` pipes the output of 1st command as the input of the 2nd command.
   *  `grep '==='` filters the output to show only the lines that contain multiple = characters.
  
   which showed several lines:
   ```
   }========== the
   3JprD========== passwordi
   ~fDV3========== is
   D9========== FGUW5ilLVJrxX9kMYMmlN4MgbpfMiqey
   ```
   among which the fourth one was the password
   ```
   FGUW5ilLVJrxX9kMYMmlN4MgbpfMiqey
   ```

##  Level 10 -> Level 11
The goal of this level was to find the password for Bandit Level 11, which was stored in a file named `data.txt` containing base64-encoded data.

### Method
1. I logged into Bandit Level 10 using the following command:
   ```
   ssh bandit10@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
   ```
2. Then I, executed the following command to decode the base64-encoded data:
   ```
   base64 -d data.txt
   ```
where
* `base64 -d`: Decodes base64-encoded data and outputs the decoded content

  which showed the password for the next level
  ```
  The password is dtR173fZKb0RRsDFSGsg2RWnpNVj3qRr
  ```

## Level 11 -> Level 12
The goal of this level was to find the password for Bandit Level 12, which was stored in a file named `data.txt` where all lowercase and uppercase letters were rotated by 13 positions (ROT13).

### Method
1.  I logged into Bandit Level 11 using the following command:
   ```
   ssh bandit11@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
   ```
2. Then,I executed the following command to decode the ROT13-encoded text:
   ```
   cat data.txt | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'
   ```
   This command translated all uppercase and lowercase letters using the ROT13 mapping:
   A-Z was mapped to N-ZA-M
   a-z was mapped to n-za-m

   The decoded result was the required password for the next level.
   ```
   The password is 7x16WNeHIi5YkIhWsfFIqoognUTyj9Q4
   ```
