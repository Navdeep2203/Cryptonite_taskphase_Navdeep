# Comprehending Commands 

## Challenge 1: cat:not the pet , but the command
In this challenge, the task focused on introducing the `cat` command in linux which is a command used to read, concatenate and dislay the contents of files. The goal was to use `cat` to read a file named flag, which had the flag require for the challenge.

### Method 
1. Firstly, I connected to the pwn.college server via the SSH key.
2. When the connection was established, I navigated to the home directory where the file `flag` was stored. I executed the following command to read the file:
   ```
   cat flag
   ```

   and the command successfully printed the contents of the flag file, which revealed the flag for this challenge.

### Flag

### Method 
1. Again, I reconnected to the pwn.college server via the SSH.
2. In this challenge, the flag file was not located in
